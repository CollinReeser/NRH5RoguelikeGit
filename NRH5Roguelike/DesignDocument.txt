This file is sort of a catch all for anybody who wants to add ideas they had.
In addition, it shall be a repository for things that need to be kept in mind
while designing the framework.

Dungeon Layers Needed:
Dungeon Layer
Item Layer
Monster Layer
Totem Layer
Effects Layer
Events Layer
Pathfinding Exception Layer (Maybe)
OnceSeen Layer (What the player has seen already but has not already seen, so
				that the edges of the game screen is actuall interesting. This
				area will also be heavily dimmed compared to the area the player
				can see)
